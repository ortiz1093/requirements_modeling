3. REQUIREMENTS.
3.1. System Definition. The basic chassis and models of the FMTV hereinafter referred to as the vehicle shall be
comprised of components, parts and accessories which meet or exceed the requirements of this specification and
shall consist of chassis capable of accepting various body configurations to accommodate vehicle missions. All
vehicles shall meet all requirements in all sections of this ATPD (unless otherwise indicated) in addition to the
specific requirements in the respective annex for each model:
3.2. Vehicle Characteristics.
3.2.1. Performance Characteristics. Performance requirements shall be achieved with all models, with and without
winch, at gross vehicle weight (GVW), to include all kits unless otherwise specified, but without towed load, unless
curb weight or gross combination weight (GCW) is specified. All parasitic losses are to be used in performance
calculations, i.e., fan, alternator losses, etc. Test criteria cited in section 4 of this specification are to be considered
minimum standards.
3.2.1.1. Grade Operation. In both forward or reverse gear the vehicle shall be capable of climbing and descending a
60% longitudinal slope at GVW (VCW for LHS), 30% at GCW, (22% minimum at GCW for wrecker and LWB
Cargo’s M1085 &amp; M1086, for tractor/ M871 semitrailer combination and LHS/LHS trailer combination) with
intermediate starts and stops on a dry hard concrete surface free from loose material. There shall be no evidence of
stalling, slipping, overheating, upsetting, hesitation, leaking of fuels, lubricants or coolants, no loss of mobility or
stability, and no loss of fuel or oil pressure or flow to the engine while performing these operations. Engine must
start headed up and down slope. Due to safety concerns, reverse gear shall be at mid-point of test for a minimum
length of 2 feet.
3.2.1.2. Side Slope Operation. The vehicle shall be capable of starting and stopping the engine while on, and
traversing side slopes of up to 30% on a dry, hard concrete surface, free from loose material. There shall be no
evidence of stalling, slipping, overheating, upsetting, hesitation, leaking of fuels, lubricants or coolants, no loss of
mobility or stability, and no loss of fuel or oil pressure or flow to the engine while performing these operations.
3.2.1.3. Steering and Handling. Power steering shall be furnished with capability at rated GVW to turn steered
wheels to their limits on a stationary vehicle without leakage of power steering fluid. A mechanical connection
between steering wheel and axle steering mechanisms shall exist under all conditions.
3.2.1.4. Speed. The vehicles shall be capable of maintaining the following speeds on primary roads:
The vehicle shall be governed so as not to exceed a speed of 65 mph on level roads.
3.2.1.5. Turning. The Wall to Wall turning radius for the LMTV shall not exceed 35 feet (11 m) in one continuous
movement. The Wall to Wall turning radius for the M1083 A1 shall not exceed 40 feet (12 m). Vehicle with stated
towed items shall be capable of turning, in one continuous movement, two standard NATO 24 X 24 intersection or
24 X 24 walled intersection (7.3 x 7.3 m) roads at 90°.
3.2.1.6. Vertical Step. The vehicle (except MTV and LMTV and LHS trailers) shall, at GVW, be capable of
negotiating a 24 inch (61 cm) minimum vertical step in both forward and reverse directions in a CTIS setting of
cross country.
3.2.1.7. Fording. The vehicle shall be capable of operating in fresh and salt water in depths to 30 inch (76 cm)
without preparation. Fording for 15 minutes shall not cause engine stall, damage or degradation of vehicle
components, need for maintenance actions nor render the vehicle incapable of performing any operation of this
specification. Excepted from this requirement are any non-sealed brake components. While fording, the engine shall
be capable of being restarted when stopped for 10 minutes. Seals shall restrict the entrance of foreign matter into
bearings which are exposed to contamination during these operations. Water contamination of bearing lubricants
shall not be more than 2.0% by volume. All bearing seals shall restrict the leaking of lubricants from the bearings.
Water contamination of engine, brake fluid, transmission, transfer transmission, power steering pump, fuel tank(s)
and all differentials shall not exceed 2.0% by volume. Vented components shall be vented above the 30-inch
fording line without kit.
3.2.1.8. Range. The vehicle shall be capable at GCW (wrecker and LHS at GVW) of being operated for at least 300
miles (483 km) on highway from integral fuel capacity at an average convoy speed of not less than 25 mph (40
km/h).
3.2.1.9. Noise. The exterior noise shall not be greater than 83 dB (A) at a distance of 15 meters from the centerline
of the vehicle path when measured according to the procedure cited in paragraph 4.7.8. Interior steady-state noise at
each crew position (driver and passengers) in the cab shall be less than 85 dB (A) when PTO driven equipment, not
normally utilized during vehicle movement, is not in use.
3.2.1.10. Emissions (Reference 1.2.a). The vehicle shall comply with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
emission regulation/standards for new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines in effect at the time of sale of
the vehicle, except as allowed by EPA exemptions.
