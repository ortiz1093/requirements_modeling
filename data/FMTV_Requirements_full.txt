3.4.19. Vehicle Winch. Vehicles designated as models with winch (w/w or w/winch) shall have a self-recovery
winch as specified herein. The vehicle winch shall be front or central mounted for self-recovery for forward
deployment. The self-recovery winch shall be capable of both forward and rearward deployment. All FMTV
models shall be configured to accept the vehicle winch which shall include all controls, electrical, hydraulic and
mechanical linkage as necessary and all items necessary for permanent installation and operation. The winch shall
be provided with a free spooling capability to permit rapid deployment of the line. The winch shall have sufficient
braking devices to safely lower and hold its full rated load. Winch braking must be automatic and be fully engaged
any time the winch is stopped or not in use, and must be essentially released during reel-in operation. With winch
installed, the vehicle shall meet all approach and departure angles and ground clearance requirements. The winch
shall provide a minimum specified line pull of 10,000 lb. (4,536 kg) +/-10% (LMTV), and 15,500 lb. (6804 kg) +/-
10% (MTV) from a bare drum 1st layer (and not less than 50% of that force from the top layer) with a minimum line
speed of 15 ft/min (5 m) from a bare drum. Winch cable shall be at least 280 feet in length, with a breaking strength
to exceed 50% above maximum line pull capacity. A device shall be provided and set to prevent damage to any of
the winching system components or their mating parts. End of wire rope shall be equipped with removable clevis.
Roller assemblies shall be located at the front of the vehicle to guide the cable. All winch functions, with the
exception of the free-spooling, shall be controllable from the driver&#39;s position only. Winch free-spooling shall be
controllable from the winch only. All controls shall be of the dead man type that revert to neutral (except free spool)
when released. A snatch block shall be provided with the truck to permit using a two part line. Storage for this
hardware shall be provided. Winch design shall be in compliance with SAE J706. The maximum continuous rating
shall be such that an 85 meter line pull can be accomplished at 120°F ambient at the top layer line pull rating without
exceeding a lube oil temperature of 250°F (if hydraulic) or damaging the safety brake.
