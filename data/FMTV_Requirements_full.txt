intermediate starts and stops on a dry hard concrete surface free from loose material. There shall be no evidence of
stalling, slipping, overheating, upsetting, hesitation, leaking of fuels, lubricants or coolants, no loss of mobility or
stability, and no loss of fuel or oil pressure or flow to the engine while performing these operations. Engine must

cross country.
3.2.1.7. Fording. The vehicle shall be capable of operating in fresh and salt water in depths to 30 inch (76 cm)
without preparation. Fording for 15 minutes shall not cause engine stall, damage or degradation of vehicle
components, need for maintenance actions nor render the vehicle incapable of performing any operation of this
specification. Excepted from this requirement are any non-sealed brake components. While fording, the engine shall
be capable of being restarted when stopped for 10 minutes. Seals shall restrict the entrance of foreign matter into
bearings which are exposed to contamination during these operations. Water contamination of bearing lubricants
shall not be more than 2.0% by volume. All bearing seals shall restrict the leaking of lubricants from the bearings.
Water contamination of engine, brake fluid, transmission, transfer transmission, power steering pump, fuel tank(s)
and all differentials shall not exceed 2.0% by volume. Vented components shall be vented above the 30-inch
fording line without kit.

normally utilized during vehicle movement, is not in use.
3.2.1.10. Emissions (Reference 1.2.a). The vehicle shall comply with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
emission regulation/standards for new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines in effect at the time of sale of
the vehicle, except as allowed by EPA exemptions.
3.2.1.11. Braking. All vehicles (trucks and trailers) shall be equipped with an Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) and
shall comply with FMVSS 121. Brake linings shall be constructed from non-asbestos materials. The brake system
shall be comprised of components that will not require maintenance due to corrosion, during durability testing per
Section 4. The power source for the ABS on the FMTV Trailers shall be full time through a separate circuit on the
FMTV Truck with the backup power through the stop lamp circuit. Trailer brake system shall operate when towed
by non-ABS equipped trucks. In the event of an ABS failure, vehicle shall be able to continue the mission using the
standard air-brake system for service brakes. ABS indicator lights on the trailer as per FMVSS 121 will not be
required due to the vehicle tactical requirements.
3.2.1.11.1. Service Brakes. The service brakes shall control and hold the vehicle on a dry hard surface 60% grade,
when headed up or down slope. On a dry hard level road that is free from loose material, application of the service
brakes shall bring the vehicle (at GVW) to a complete stop from a speed of 20 mph (32 km/h) within 32 feet (9.75
m), measured from the point of brake application. Brake pedal force to achieve above performance shall be within
that possible by the full range of drivers. Application of service brakes shall cause activation of brake lights to
include override of emergency flashers unless emergency flashers consist of separate lights. At GVW and GCW the
vehicle shall pass the Jennerstown Brake tests (IAW TOP 2-2-608); ABS shall be operational on all variants during
this test.
3.2.1.11.2. Parking Brake. The parking brake shall be capable of holding the vehicle wheels from rotating where
braking is applied, at GCW on a 30% grade, headed up or downgrade, on a dry hard surface free from loose
material. An indicator light shall alert the crew when the parking brake is engaged. The parking brake system shall
at all times be capable of being applied and released by any driver&#39;s muscular effort and immediately available for
re-application. Braking energy shall not be dependent on maintenance of air or hydraulic pressure or electrical
energy.
3.2.1.11.3. Emergency Brakes. The emergency brake system, in the event of a single point failure in the service
brake system, shall stop the vehicle at least once on a 30% slope and, after emergency applications per FMVSS 121,
shall remain engaged until intentionally disengaged by operating personnel. The only exceptions to this are for the
tractor model when hauling an M871A1/A2 semi-trailer and LHS/LHS trailer at GCW, in which case, it shall meet
these requirements on a 22% slope. Emergency braking shall include a means of providing adequate vehicle
stopping in the event of a trailer breakaway.

3.2.1.12. Survivability. Vehicle design shall incorporate consideration of vehicle and crew survivability as follows:
in general, the design shall protect such vulnerable components as air, fluid, and electrical lines and components by
routing or placement in areas shielded by heavier components. These and other components critical to vehicle
operation shall be protected to the extent possible without serious departure from standard automotive design
principles. Any components exposed up to 40 inches from the ground with the emergency CTIS setting in force, to
include hoses, cables, lanyards, lines, tanks, valves, wires, cylinders, boxes, shall be shielded or able to withstand,
going in forward or reverse, with no degradation of vehicle operation: the repeated impact of brush and tree
branches; dry debris raised by cross country operation; soil scraping at 5 mph.

cab, body assemblies, kits, cranes and ancillary equipment shall continue to function when exposed to emissions
from Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) and Near Strike Lightning (NSL). Emissions from the FMTV shall not
cause Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) with mission critical equipment located within the FMTV or in the
surrounding area. EMC Radiated Susceptibility (RS) requirements for external electromagnetic environments for
Army ground systems are listed in Table I.c of MIL-STD-464. FMTV shall meet the requirements of
MIL-STD-464, Electrostatic Charge Control section 5.7, NSL Section 5.4 and EMI Section 5.6. All vehicle and kit
configurations shall not have any inherent Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) characteristics.
3.2.1.12.2. High Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HAEMP). All mission essential functions (6.3.19) shall meet
operational requirements when fully tested to verify operation, within a maximum of 15 minutes maintenance by the
crew (using only on-board tools) after exposure to a HAEMP specified in MIL-STD-2169B (S) and QSTAG-244
Edition 4.
3.2.1.12.3. Blackout Condition Lighting. Blackout condition lighting shall be provided in accordance with
MIL-STD-1179. No other vehicle lighting shall be capable of being activated while in the blackout mode except

and secondary roads and trails for the appropriate mobility level stated herein under the varied environmental
conditions encountered. Other FMTV models shall perform to a level appropriate to their GVW. If the MTV cargo
model with MHE requires CTIS to meet the mobility requirements of 3.2.1.13 and 3.2.1.13.1 then all FMTV models
shall have CTIS. The mobility characteristics shall equal or exceed those quantified by the following NATO

than 25 at the tire inflation pressure for snow/mud/sand, if CTIS equipped. If not equipped with CTIS, shall permit
vehicle speeds up to 40 mph for continuous operation on roads, trails, and cross-country. Other FMTV models shall
perform to a level appropriate to their GVW. The single pass VCI1 (fine grained) at GCW (MTV Cargo with MHE
towing an MTV Trailer) shall be no greater than 35 at the above tire pressures. The calculated VCI1 (fine grained)
shall employ the deflection ratio effect algorithms.
